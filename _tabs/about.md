Welcome to Crackers' blog site!

I'm a third year Computer Science undergrad at the University of Waterloo.

In high school, I spent a lot of time writing [programming contests](https://ericpei.ca/posts/contest-history/). I initially created this site for my [programming blogs](https://ericpei.ca/posts/what-is-this/). Since starting university, I've put competitive programming aside to pursue other goals. I still do contests for fun, but haven't trained seriously in ages.

I've written plenty about my university experiences and I've been thinking of making some blog posts out of them. We'll see if this happens...

Cheers! üçª
