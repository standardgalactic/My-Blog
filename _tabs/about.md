Welcome to Eric Pei (crackersamdjam)'s blog site.

I'm a second year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo. I spend a lot of time writing [programming contests](https://ericpei.ca/posts/contest-history/). I also occasionally write blogs about programming. [Here](https://ericpei.ca/posts/what-is-this/) is the motivation behind my blogs.
