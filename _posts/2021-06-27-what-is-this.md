Back in February 2020, I wrote the Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) and received a perfect score. My programming teacher suggested that his students write a blog on the contest. A month later, when Canada entered Coronoavirus lockdown, I scraped together a website on which to publish my CCC 2020 blog. There was so much cool stuff about programming I wanted to share, so I thought that I would quickly fill up my blog. However, I never had to motivation to package up my ideas into presentable content.

Recently, I found out about Jekyll. I much prefer writing in Markdown over HTML. Plus, this Jekyll site has a ton of features. I hope that now, I'll write more to share my experiences.

I've moved over my old CCC 2020 blog and I plan on writing about topics such as recent contests, algorithm tutorials, and even non-technical subjects such as my programming mindset.

Thanks for reading this far and I hope I'll have a lot more content up by the time you read this. ðŸ‘‹
